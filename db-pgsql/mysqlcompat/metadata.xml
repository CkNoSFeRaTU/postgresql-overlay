This project is a collection of functions, aggregates, operators and
casts that make PostgreSQL mimic MySQL as closely as possible.

To use the project, you can either find and install the few functions
that you need, or run all the .sql files to install the complete
compatibility environment.

This can be an immense time-saver when porting large applications that
rely heavily on certain MySQL functions.
