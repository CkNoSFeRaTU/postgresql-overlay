The following projects are missing right now:

- gdal
    - ogr_fdw

- mysqlmigrator

- ora2pg
    -> needs DBD::Oracle and instant client
- oracle_fdw
    -> needs instant client

- pagila
    -> should we make an ebuild for this? it is just a SQL file ...

- pgMail
    -> should we make an ebuild for this? it is just a SQL file ...
    -> only reason i can think of would be the tcl dependency for postgresql use flags

- pg_bulkload
    -> https://bugs.gentoo.org/571046

- pg_filedump
    -> does not compile with current postgresql releases
    -> may need some heavy patching
    -> ignore it for now ( its a stale project anyway )

- pg_shard
    -> is deprecated and replaced by citus
    -> is it worth packaging?


`eselect postgresql update` should be called by all packages,
that install binaries

PostgreSQL 11 support should be prepared
