# PostgreSQL Overlay for Gentoo

The goal of this overlay is, to provide the same packages as the official debian and redhat repositories of the PostgreSQL Project

## Categories

### db-pgsql

I introduced this category as there are many, many extensions and tools for the PostgreSQL database. Like www-apache, this category holds everything that is PostgreSQL specific.

Every package, that installs into the PostgreSQL Version specific directories is kept here.
